# Time series project (hackathon)

# Objective

In this hackathon, youâ€™ll get to test your multistep time series forecasting skills with exogenous data! The objective is to forecast pollution levels for the next seven days.

The data.csv file contains three columns: time, PM2.5 and exog. The PM2.5 corresponds to the pollutant readings at each hour, which is what you want to predict. The exog corresponds to the wind speed forecast, which is the exogenous data that may be useful to make your predictions. Note that the last 168 values of the PM2.5 are missing, because these correspond to the values you are expected to predict.

# Context

PM2.5 are particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. These are some of the most dangerous pollutants and increase the risk of getting diseases like respiratory infections, lung cancer, and heart disease. Accurate forecasting of these pollutants with appropriate lead time can help implement more effective policies in cities with high levels of pollution.
